# QChomp
This is a small project which shows how machine learning might be used in a simple [game of Chomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp).
AI uses reinforcement learning technique called Q-learning and therefore is able to learn how to play Chomp playing against itself.

The project currently consists of the core library, console application and basic web app created with Razor Pages to showcase the AI on a 6x9 field.
Console application can be used for testing various field sizes as well as AI settings (epsilon rate, learning rate and number of training games).
Generated AI models might be saved and loaded as JSON-files.

## How to use
Download the latest verison from Releases page and run.

 --save             Save model with autogenerated name.
 --save [filename]  Save model with the given name.
